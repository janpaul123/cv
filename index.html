								<p class="less-relevant">
									At <a href="http://brigade.com" target="_blank">Brigade</a> we are trying to tackle the problem of declining <strong>citizen power and engagement in American democracy</strong>. The company, which raised $9.5 million from investors led by Sean Parker, Marc Benioff, and Ron Conway, is building tools for expressing your civic identity, learning about your friends and neighbours, and working toward common goals together.
								</p>

								<p class="last">
									I&rsquo;m working on the web application, where I mainly focus on features for <strong>customer growth</strong>; several of my proposals and implementations have significantly increased our rate of acquisition. I introduced <strong>engineering practices</strong> that keep the complexity of our application contained, and I created a system for managing, visualising, and testing <strong>analytics events</strong> and <strong>experiments</strong>. <span class="less-relevant">Sometimes my work results in open source projects, such as a <a href="https://github.com/brigade/delayed-scroll-restoration-polyfill" target="_blank">polyfill for delayed scroll restoration</a>.</span>

							<h3>Versal (web developer)</h3>
							<div class="item">
								At <a href="http://versal.com" target="_blank">Versal</a> I worked on the core product: an <strong>authoring tool for interactive courses</strong>, built from the belief that we are vastly underutilising the computer&rsquo;s potential in education. Based on lessons learned, I co-authored a new API for &ldquo;gadgets&rdquo; &mdash; building blocks of courses, such as videos, quizzes, simulations, games, and so on. We launched our development platform with this new API, and it was well received by gadget developers (much of the API has been <a href="https://github.com/Versal/" target="_blank">released as open source</a>). I also <strong>mentored</strong> several junior engineers, <strong>spoke at industry events</strong>, and advised on <strong>systems architecture and product design</strong>.
